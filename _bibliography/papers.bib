  title={A Variational AutoEncoder for model independent searches of new physics at LHC},
  author={Lavizzari, Giulia and Govoni, Pietro and Gennai, Simone and Boldrini, Giacomo},
  abstract={We present a feasibility study for the use of a generative, probabilistic model, a Variational Autoencoder 
            (VAE), to detect deviations from Standard Model (SM) physics in an electroweak process at the Large Hadron 
            Collider (LHC). The new physics responsible for the anomalies is described through an Effective Field Theory 
            (EFT) approach: the SM Lagrangian is Taylor-expanded and the higher order terms cause deviations in the 
            kinematic distributions of the observables, and are thus identified by the model as anomalous contributions 
            with respect to SM. Since the training of the model involves mainly only SM events, the proposed strategy 
            is largely independent from any assumption on the nature of the new physics signature. To test the proposed 
            strategy we use parton level generations of Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) events at the LHC, assuming an 
            integrated luminosity of 350/fb.},

  title={Adaptive Voronoi Binning in Muon Radiography for Detecting Subsurface Cavities},
  author={Paccagnella, Andrea and Ciulli, Vitaliano and Bonechi, Lorenzo and D'Alessandro, Raffaello and
          Frosin, Catalin and Borselli, Diletta and Gonzi, Sandro and Beni, Tommaso},
  abstract={Muon radiography is an advanced imaging technique that utilizes cosmic muons to visualize the 
            interior of structures and materials, making it highly valuable for subsurface investigations.
            In this study, we present a measurement conducted using muon radiography at the Temperino mine.
            We demonstrate the application of an adaptive binning approach using Voronoi tessellation to 
            enhance image visualization and improve cavity detection. The results reveal that the adaptive 
            binning technique significantly improves the visibility of regions with cavities. The combination 
            of muon radiography and adaptive binning through Voronoi tessellation showcases its potential as 
            a powerful tool for subsurface exploration and geological studies, providing a more accurate and 
            reliable approach for cavity detection and characterization.},

  title={Optimizing Deep Learning Models for Cell Recognition in Fluorescence Microscopy: The Impact 
         of Loss Functions on Performance and Generalization},
  author={Clissa, Luca and Macaluso, Antonio and Zoccoli, Antonio},
  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of fluorescence microscopy, the application of deep learning techniques 
            for automatic cell segmentation presents exciting opportunities and challenges. In this work, we 
            investigate the impact of loss functions and evaluation metrics on model performance and generalization 
            in the context of cell recognition. First, we present extensive experiments with different commonly 
            used loss functions and offer practical insights and guidelines, underscoring how the choice of a 
            loss function can influence model performance. Second, we conduct a detailed examination of several 
            evaluation metrics with their relative benefits and drawbacks, helping to guide effective model evaluation 
            and comparison in the field. hird, we discuss how characteristics specific to fluorescence microscopy 
            data impact model generalization. Precisely, we examine how factors such as cell sizes, color irregularities, 
            and textures can potentially affect the performance and adaptability of these models to new data. 
            Collectively, these insights provide a nuanced understanding of deep learning for automatic cell 
            segmentation, shedding light on best practices, evaluation strategies, and model generalization. 
            We hope this study can serve as a beneficial resource for researchers and practitioners working 
            on similar applications, fostering further advancements in the field.},

         for the COVID-19 Infection},
  author={Zurlo, Giovanni and Ronchieri, Elisabetta},
  abstract={During the COVID-19 pandemic, a huge amount of literature was produced covering different aspects 
            of infection. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has been shown to improve 
            screening, diagnosis, treatment, and medication for the COVID-19 virus. Applying natural language 
            processing (NLP) solutions to COVID-19 literature has contributed to infer significant 
            COVID-19-related topics and correlated diseases. In this paper, we aim at evaluating biomedical 
            transformer-based NLP techniques in COVID-19 research to understand if they are able to classify 
            problems related to COVID-19. Particularly, once collected COVID-19 publications encompassing 
            the terms AI and medical imaging, fifteen BERT-based models have been compared with respect 
            to modality prediction and task prediction.},

  author={Graziani, Valerio and Iorio, Giulia and Ridolfi, Stefano and Merucci, Chiara and

  abstract={To enhance the deep understanding of artists’mindset and technical practices the detailed 
            characterization of paintings require the net of brushstrokes on the surface to be considered 
            as informative. Laser profilometry is being coupled with a macro x-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) 
            device as a non-destructive, non-invasive, portable tool for such an investigation. A set of 
            different brushstrokes was surveyed by testing the necessary sampling conditions and verifying 
            the compatibility with the MA-XRF working conditions. Eight different surveyed sample brushstrokes 
            proved to be clearly informative of a variety of features useful to characterize the gesturality 
            of the artist’s hand.},
