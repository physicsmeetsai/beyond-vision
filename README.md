# Beyond Vision: Physics meets AI
The workshop Beyond Vision: Physics meets AI ([BVPAI 2023](https://physicsmeetsai.github.io/beyond-vision)), to be held during the 22nd International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing ([ICIAP 2023](https://iciap2023.org)), is the first ICIAP workshop dedicated to applications of Statistical Learning methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques to Nuclear and other Physics-based Imaging technologies.

## Topics

The workshop is organized in two main tracks:

**1. _Nuclear & other Physics-based Imaging technologies_**
  - Nuclear (& other Physics-based extended)  Computer Vision for Cultural Heritage
  - Particle Accelerators applications: imaging, software and statistical analysis
  - Stastical learning for Astronomy
  - X-ray, Neutron and Proton image analysis and processing for Medical Physics
  - AI-enhanced experimental apparatus
  - Neutron and X-Ray-based Tomographic analysis for applied physics
  - Multimodal analysis methods

**2. _Generative Models & other disruptive Deep Learning methods for Physical Sciences_**
  - Density estimation
  - Anomaly detection
  - Physics-informed systems
  - Fast detector simulation
  - Synthetic data augmentation
  - Other SOTA methods for Physics Data Analysis and processing
