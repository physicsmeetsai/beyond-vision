The workshop **Beyond Vision: Physics meets AI**, to be held within the 22nd International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2023), is the first ICIAP workshop dedicated to applications of Statistical Learning methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques to Nuclear and other Physics-based Imaging technologies.

In the recent years, we have witnessed the incredible rise of Artificial Intelligence in all physical sciences: from Computer Vision techniques driven by Nuclear Imaging for painting restoration, to deep generative models used to look for signs of New Physics with the big experiments at CERN. Those technologies are becoming ubiquitus in research activities, pushing research towards the most advanced tools and techniques developed in Computer Vision.

The aim of the workshop is to furnish researchers with different backgrounds a place to share experiences, learn best practices and contribute to the discussion about the current challenges on the application of Statistical Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods to various physics domains.
