### Aims and scope

The workshop **Beyond Vision: Physics meets AI** (BVPAI), to be held within the _22nd International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing_ (ICIAP 2023), is the first ICIAP workshop dedicated to applications of Statistical Learning methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques to Nuclear and other Physics-based Imaging technologies.

In the recent years, we have witnessed the incredible rise of **Artificial Intelligence** in all physical sciences: from Computer Vision techniques driven by Nuclear Imaging for painting restoration, to deep generative models used to look for signs of New Physics with the big experiments at CERN. Those technologies are becoming ubiquitus in research activities, pushing research towards the most advanced tools and techniques developed in Computer Vision.

The aim of the workshop is to furnish researchers with different backgrounds a place to **share experiences**, **learn best practices** and contribute to the discussion about the **current challenges** on the application of Statistical Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods to various physics domains.

### Topics

The workshop is organized in two main tracks:

1. <u>Nuclear & other Physics-based Imaging technologies</u>
  - Nuclear (& other Physics-based extended)  Computer Vision for Cultural Heritage
  - Particle Accelerators applications: imaging, software and statistical analysis
  - Stastical learning for Astronomy
  - X-ray, Neutron and Proton image analysis and processing for Medical Physics
  - AI-enhanced experimental apparatus
  - Neutron and X-Ray-based Tomographic analysis for applied physics
  - Multimodal analysis methods

2. <u>Generative Models & other disruptive Deep Learning methods for Physical Sciences</u>
  - Density estimation
  - Anomaly detection
  - Physics-informed systems
  - Fast detector simulation
  - Synthetic data augmentation
  - Other SOTA methods for Physics Data Analysis and processing

### Key dates

- **Paper submission deadline:** July 10th, 2023
- **Decision to authors:** July 31st, 2023
- **Camera ready papers due:** August 20th, 2023
- **Workshop date:** TBA
