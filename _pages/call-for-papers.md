### Topics

The workshop is organised in two main tracks:

1. **Nuclear & other Physics-based Imaging technologies**
    - Nuclear (& other Physics-based extended)  Computer Vision for Cultural Heritage
    - Particle Accelerators applications: imaging, software and statistical analysis
    - Stastical learning for Astronomy
    - X-ray, Neutron and Proton image analysis and processing for Medical Physics
    - AI-enhanced experimental apparatus
    - Neutron and X-Ray-based Tomographic analysis for applied physics
    - Multimodal analysis methods

2. **Generative Models & other disruptive Deep Learning methods for Physical Sciences**
    - Density estimation
    - Anomaly detection
    - Physics-informed systems
    - Fast detector simulation
    - Synthetic data augmentation
    - Other SOTA methods for Physics Data Analysis and processing
  
### Submission and Review

 We invite submission of papers describing work in the domains suggested above or in closely-related areas.

 The workshop's reviewing of submissions will be **double-blind**. Accepted submissions will be presented either as oral resentation or posters at the workshop, and will be published by Springer as Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS), in he ICIAP 2023 Workshops volume.

 The maximum number of pages is 10 + 2 pages for references. While preparing their contributions, authors must follow the uidelines and technical instructions provided by Springer (see [Springer guideline](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/ncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and [Springer Overleaf LaTex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pringer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi)).

 Each accepted paper must be covered by at least **one registered author**. Registration can be either for the full event (5 days) at a regular rate or just for workshops and tutorials (2 days).
